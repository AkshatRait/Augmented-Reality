          <h1>What is Augmented Reality (AR) ?
          </h1>
          <p>Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. Unlike virtual reality, which creates a totally artificial environment, augmented reality uses the existing environment and overlays new information on top of it.

              <p class="lead">Augmented Reality (AR) is emerging as one of the key drivers of the tech economy. By some estimates, the total value of the AR market is expected to reach $100 billion by 2020.That's because AR apps, headsets, and smart glasses hold the promise to add value to virtually every industry - from retail to industrial manufacturing. AR is already showing potential to solve some of the biggest problems and pain points, and we likely won't have to wait until 2020 for AR to make a big impact across the board.

                <p class="card-text"><strong>Medical Training </strong><br>It is already being used to make healthcare safer and more precise. The use of AR in education enables medical students to gain a better understanding of human anatomy, provides guidance for drawing blood, and helps health professionals navigate through complex spinal surgeries.From operating MRI equipment to performing complex surgeries, AR tech holds the potential to boost the depth and effectiveness of medical training in many areas. Students at the Cleveland Clinic at Case Western Reserve University, for example, will now learn anatomy utilizing an AR headset allowing them to delve into the human body in an interactive 3D format.

                <p class="card-text"><strong>Classroom Education</strong><br> While technology like tablets have become widespread in many schools and classrooms, teachers and educators are now ramping up student's learning experience with AR. The Aurasma app, for example, is already being used in classrooms so that students can view their classes via a smartphone or tablet for a more rich learning environment. Students learning about astronomy might see a full map of the solar system, or those in a music class might be able to see musical notes in real time as they learn to play an instrument.

                <p class="card-text"><strong>Retail</strong><br>In today's physical retail environment, shoppers are using their smartphones more than ever to compare prices or look up additional information on products they're browsing. World-famous motorcycle brand Harley Davidson is one great instance of a brand making the most of this trend, by developing an AR app that shoppers can use in-store. Users can view a motorcycle they might be interested in buying in the showroom, and customize it using the app to see which colors and features they might like.</p>

                <p class="card-text"><strong>Repair & Maintenance </strong><br>One of AR's biggest industrial use cases is for the repair and maintenance of complex equipment. Whether it's a car motor or an MRI machine, repair and maintenance staff are beginning to use AR headsets and glasses. At the same time, they perform their jobs to provide them with useful information on the spot, suggest potential fixes, and point out potential trouble areas. This use case will only continue to get stronger as machine-to-machine IoT technology grows and can feed information directly to AR headsets.

Moreover, first responders arrive on the scene of a fire or earthquake trying to figure out who needs help, and the best way to get them to safety. AR is showing promise in solving both pieces of the public safety puzzle. First responders wearing AR glasses can be alerted to dangerous areas, and show in real-time individuals that need assistance while enabling them to still be aware of their surroundings. For those in need, geolocation-enabled AR can show them directions, and the best route to, safe zones and areas with firefighters or medics.</p>

                </strong><br> Technology has gone a long way towards advancing the tourism industry in recent years, from review sites like TripAdvisor to informative website like Lonely Planet. But AR presents a huge opportunity for travel brands and agents to give potential tourists an even more immersive experience before they travel. Imagine taking a virtual "Walkabout" Australia before on AR glasses before booking a ticket to Sydney, or a leisurely stroll around Paris to see what museums or cafes you might like to visit. AR promises to make selling trips, travel, and vacations a whole lot easier in the future.</p>
